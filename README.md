This is my first ever css and html project. The project is of a NinjaMan and works like Pac-Man. In this project, I've added
  (i) Onigiri as an altenative food to eat
  (ii) the up direction

To improve the game, I need to add;
  (i) random world generated  when loading the page (intermediate)
  (ii) add ghosts that chase ninjaman around (Advanced)
  (iii) Give NinjaMan 3 lives where Game Over occurs when a Ghost hits Ninjaman 3 times (Advanced)
  (iv) keep score of how many sushi's ninjaman eats
